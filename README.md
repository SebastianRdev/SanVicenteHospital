## 🧠 Technical Notes

* The system is built with an architecture based on **repositories and services**, separating business logic from the user interface.
* Data is stored in memory (in `Database.cs`) to simplify execution.
* Emails are handled through the `EmailService`, which centralizes logic and prevents duplication within the UI layer.
